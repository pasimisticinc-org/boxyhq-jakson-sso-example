## Step 1: Create Application

You'll need to create a new **Custom App** from your Rippling account if the app is not already in the Rippling app directory.

Go to **IT Management** > **Custom App** from the left navigation menu.

Click **Create New App** button to create a new application.

From the next screen, fill in the following fields:

- **App Name**
- **Select Categories**
- **Upload Logo**
- **What type of app would you like to create?** - Make sure you select **Single Sign-On (SAML)** from the list.
