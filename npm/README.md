# SAML Jackson (not fiction anymore)

SAML service [SAML in a box from BoxyHQ]

You need someone like Jules Winnfield to save you from the vagaries of SAML login. Jackson implements the SAML login flow as an OAuth 2.0 flow, abstracting away all the complexities of the SAML protocol.

## Install as an npm library

Jackson is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@boxyhq/saml-jackson) that can be integrated into any web application framework (like Express.js for example). Please file an issue or submit a PR if you encounter any issues with your choice of framework.

```bash
npm install @boxyhq/saml-jackson
```
