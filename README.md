SAML Jackson bridges or proxies a SAML login flow to OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect, abstracting away all the complexities of the SAML protocol. It also supports Directory Sync via the SCIM 2.0 protocol for automatic user and group provisioning/de-provisioning.

> We now also support OpenID Connect providers.

## Directory Sync

SAML Jackson also supports Directory Sync based on the SCIM 2.0 protocol.

Directory sync helps organizations automate the provisioning and de-provisioning of their users. As a result, it streamlines the user lifecycle management process by saving valuable organizational hours, creating a single truth source of the user identity data, and facilitating them to keep the data secure.

## üöÄ Getting Started with SAML Jackson

There are two ways to integrate SAML Jackson into an application. Depending on your use case, you can choose either of them. <br>

1. [As a separate service](https://boxyhq.com/docs/jackson/deploy/service) ([Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application) This includes an admin portal out of the box for managing SSO and Directory Sync connections.
2. [NPM library](https://boxyhq.com/docs/jackson/deploy/npm-library) as an embedded library in your application.

### Try A Demo

- Try our hosted demo showcasing the SAML service provider (SP) initiated [login flow here](https://saml-demo.boxyhq.com), which uses our [Mock SAML](https://mocksaml.com) IdP service.
- Try an Identity Provider (IdP) initiated [login flow here](https://mocksaml.com/saml/login).

### Deploying SAML Jackson as a separate service locally

Let's get you to Hello SAML Jackson in no time.

#### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) at version `18.14.2` or higher

> It is generally a good idea to install and maintain Node.js versions using a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nvs](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs) on Windows. More [information is available here](https://schalkneethling.com/posts/installing-node-and-managing-versions).

#### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/boxyhq/jackson.git
cd jackson
```

#### Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

#### Setup environment variables

Create a `.env` from the existing `.env.example` file in the root of the project.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

> **Environment variable documentation:** Have a look at https://boxyhq.com/docs/jackson/deploy/env-variables for all of the available environment variables.

#### Database

For the rest of the setup, we will use a PostgreSQL database. The easiest way to get PostgreSQL up and running on macOS is by using Postgres.app. You can download it from [https://postgresapp.com/](https://postgresapp.com/).

> For other operating systems and alternative options for MacOS, please see the [documentation available on the Prisma website](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/postgresql/setting-up-a-local-postgresql-database).

#### Start the development server

Now that we have our database running we can start the development server. But before we do, we need a way to log into the admin portal.

To log in to the admin portal we either need to [configure magic links](https://boxyhq.com/docs/admin-portal/overview#1-magic-links), or [enable username and password](https://boxyhq.com/docs/admin-portal/overview#2-email-and-password) login. The easiest one, and the one we will use, is to enable username and password login.

In your `.env` find the `NEXTAUTH_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. We need to provide an `email:password` combination that we can then use to log in to the admin portal. For example:

```bash
NEXTAUTH_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS=admin@example.com:password
```

Now we can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5225` in your browser and you should be redirected to the login screen.

At the login screen, you can now use the username and password you set in the `NEXTAUTH_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to log in. Click "Sign In" and you should be logged in and see the SSO Connections page with no configured connections. We have reached Hello SAML Jackson!
